Contains the methods used to turn the diamante poem into a .txt file and read 
it out loud. file_creator() creates the file with the poem and scores 
represented as a single string; this was done because the readline function 
would have trouble reading the entire poem and scored formatted with newlines; 
the function also returns the filename because file_reader is called using it 
by the main; this prevents the chance there is an error inputting the local 
file. file_reader() reads the contents of the .txt files.
