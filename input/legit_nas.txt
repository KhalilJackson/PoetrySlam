Bravehearts
Yeah
Yeah
My beginnings was intense
Who'da thought I go legit
Fasho, yeah, yeah

We comin' blacker than Black Panther 2
Nobody this thorough, that's the truth
Never go against the family, that's something you don't do
Don't get Eddie Kane'd tryin' to sing your way back in the group (Nah)
Stars in the ceiling, God's Son in the building, rep that 7-1-8
It's hard to depart from that feeling, careful selling weight
The DA be watchin' you dealing
Get yourself straight
Before they find that paraphernalia
For those who claim a hundred million on taxes, beautiful actresses
Street dudes who turned activist, who used to move packages
Know Nas still here to remove the wall that our back against
Legitimize all your hustles before the gavel hit

It takes wakin' up early to face the moment debatin'
Should I save it or blow it, I mean, it's only some paper
None of my neighbors too nosy, the Joneses ownin' some acres
To be the greatest is lonely, but it chose me, I take it
Whatever the case may be
I'm outta space, O.D
NASA without the A at the end
Takeoff on three
What's the cost of a CD?
When 1500 plays is one sale
What's that to 1500 P's on one scale
For a starving artist trying to sneak out and reroute
Originality I seek out, let's clean house
To black homeowners, check it out
To black homeowners, take over and throw the lease out
This that movie reel, the Jordan Peele of this thing
Low-key, boss shit, pulling strings behind the scenes

On my soul, this for my kids, and the cold shit I done did
All them O's I tried to flip, who woulda thought I'd go legit? Yeah
And the cold shit I done did
Pretty girls who let me hit, who woulda thought I'd go legit? Yeah (Woo)
And the cold shit that you did
All them O's you tried to flip, who woulda thought you'd go legit? (Oh!)

Grown man business, Covid closed jail visits
Stoves still lit
Many still on the scales where the system failed my n*****
In the trial hearing, no bail, eye witness showed up, and snitches
I read Jesus' diary and ran and tell the streets
No, this ain't no hype, we in the belly of the beast
All they said was I would be a felon, be deceased
Instead I'm in Margiela and Loewe with the crease
The consummate, kill 'em all, call the bomb squad and the SWAT for this, uh
Got off the block for this, yeah

On my soul this for the kids, and the cold shit that I did
Pretty girls who let me hit, it's only right I went legit? (Uh, 2 legit)
And the cold shit I done did
All them O's I tried to flip, who woulda thought I'd go legit? (Yeah, I do it for y'all)
And the cold shit that you did
All them O's you tried to flip, who woulda thought you'd go legit? (Do it for y'all)

Yeah
We was just chillin' on the sofa
No job, no school
Ghetto babies
I was small time
Small time to big time, you can do it too
Go legit, yeah
Believe in yourself
Live the life you deserve
That's how we do
I ain't forget the roaches and mice
I ain't forget all that
